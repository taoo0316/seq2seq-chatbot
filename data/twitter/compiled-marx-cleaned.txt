The history hitherto existing societies history class struggles 
Freeman slave patrician plebeian lord serf guildmaster journeyman word oppressor oppressed stood constant opposition one another carried uninterrupted hidden open fight fight time ended either revolutionary reconstitution society large common ruin contending classes 
In earlier epochs history find almost everywhere complicated arrangement society various orders manifold gradation social rank 
In ancient 
Rome patricians knights plebeians slaves 
Middle 
Ages feudal lords vassals guildmasters journeymen apprentices serfs almost classes again subordinate gradations 
The modern bourgeois society sprouted ruins feudal society done away class antagonisms 
It established new classes new conditions oppression new forms struggle place old ones 
Our epoch epoch bourgeoisie possesses however distinctive feature simplified class antagonisms 
Society whole splitting two great hostile camps two great classes directly facing other 
Bourgeoisie 
Proletariat 
From serfs 
Middle 
Ages sprang chartered burghers earliest towns 
From burgesses first elements bourgeoisie developed 
The discovery 
America rounding 
Cape opened fresh ground rising bourgeoisie 
The 
East
Indian 
Chinese markets colonisation 
America trade colonies increase means exchange commodities generally gave commerce navigation industry impulse never known thereby revolutionary element tottering feudal society rapid development 
The feudal system industry industrial production monopolised closed guilds longer sufficed growing wants new markets 
The manufacturing system took place 
The guildmasters pushed one side manufacturing middle class division labour different corporate guilds vanished face division labour single workshop 
Meantime markets kept ever growing demand ever rising 
Even manufacture longer sufficed 
Thereupon steam machinery revolutionised industrial production 
The place manufacture taken giant 
Modern 
Industry place industrial middle class industrial millionaires leaders whole industrial armies modern bourgeois 
Modern industry established worldmarket discovery 
America paved way 
This market given immense development commerce navigation communication land 
This development has time reacted extension industry proportion industry commerce navigation railways extended proportion bourgeoisie developed increased capital pushed background every class handed 
Middle 
Ages 
We see therefore modern bourgeoisie product long course development series revolutions modes production exchange 
Each step development bourgeoisie accompanied corresponding political advance class 
An oppressed class sway feudal nobility armed selfgoverning association mediaeval commune independent urban republic  taxable third estate monarchy  afterwards period manufacture proper serving either semifeudal absolute monarchy counterpoise nobility and fact cornerstone great monarchies general bourgeoisie last since establishment 
Modern 
Industry worldmarket conquered itself modern representative 
State exclusive political sway 
The executive modern 
State committee managing common affairs whole bourgeoisie 
The bourgeoisie historically played revolutionary part 
The bourgeoisie wherever got upper hand put end feudal patriarchal idyllic relations 
It pitilessly torn asunder motley feudal ties bound man natural superiors left remaining nexus man man naked selfinterest callous cash payment 
It drowned heavenly ecstasies religious fervour chivalrous enthusiasm philistine sentimentalism icy water egotistical calculation 
It resolved personal worth exchange value place numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms set single unconscionable freedom
Free 
Trade 
In one word exploitation veiled religious political illusions naked shameless direct brutal exploitation 
The bourgeoisie stripped halo every occupation hitherto honoured looked reverent awe 
It converted physician lawyer priest poet man science paid wage labourers 
The bourgeoisie torn away family sentimental veil reduced family relation mere money relation 
The bourgeoisie disclosed came pass brutal display vigour 
Middle 
Ages 
Reactionists much admire found fitting complement slothful indolence 
It first show mans activity bring about 
It accomplished wonders far surpassing 
Egyptian pyramids 
Roman aqueducts 
Gothic cathedrals conducted expeditions put shade former 
Exoduses nations crusades 
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising instruments production thereby relations production whole relations society 
Conservation old modes production unaltered form was contrary first condition existence earlier industrial classes 
Constant revolutionising production uninterrupted disturbance social conditions everlasting uncertainty agitation distinguish bourgeois epoch earlier ones 
All fixed fastfrozen relations train ancient venerable prejudices opinions swept away newformed ones become antiquated ossify 
All solid melts air holy profaned man last compelled face sober senses real conditions life relations kind 
The need constantly expanding market products chases bourgeoisie whole surface globe 
It must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connexions everywhere 
The bourgeoisie exploitation worldmarket given cosmopolitan character production consumption every country 
To great chagrin 
Reactionists drawn feet industry national ground stood 
All oldestablished national industries destroyed daily destroyed 
They dislodged new industries whose introduction becomes life death question civilised nations industries longer work indigenous raw material raw material drawn remotest zones industries whose products consumed home every quarter globe 
In place old wants satisfied productions country find new wants requiring satisfaction products distant lands climes 
In place old local national seclusion selfsufficiency intercourse every direction universal interdependence nations 
And material also intellectual production 
The intellectual creations individual nations become common property 
National onesidedness narrowmindedness become impossible numerous national local literatures arises world literature 
The bourgeoisie rapid improvement instruments production immensely facilitated means communication draws all even barbarian nations civilisation 
The cheap prices commodities heavy artillery batters 
Chinese walls forces barbarians intensely obstinate hatred foreigners capitulate 
It compels nations pain extinction adopt bourgeois mode production compels introduce calls civilisation midst ie become bourgeois themselves 
In one word creates world image 
The bourgeoisie subjected country rule towns 
It created enormous cities greatly increased urban population compared rural thus rescued considerable part population idiocy rural life 
Just made country dependent towns made barbarian semibarbarian countries dependent civilised ones nations peasants nations bourgeois 
East 
West 
The bourgeoisie keeps away scattered state population means production property 
It agglomerated production concentrated property hands 
The necessary consequence political centralisation 
Independent loosely connected provinces separate interests laws governments systems taxation became lumped together one nation one government one code laws one national classinterest one frontier one customstariff 
The bourgeoisie rule scarce one hundred years created massive colossal productive forces preceding generations together 
Subjection 
Natures forces man machinery application chemistry industry agriculture steamnavigation railways electric telegraphs clearing whole continents cultivation canalisation rivers whole populations conjured groundwhat earlier century even presentiment productive forces slumbered lap social labour 
We see then means production exchange whose foundation bourgeoisie built up generated feudal society 
At certain stage development means production exchange conditions feudal society produced exchanged feudal organisation agriculture manufacturing industry one word feudal relations property became longer compatible already developed productive forces became many fetters 
They burst asunder burst asunder 
Into place stepped free competition accompanied social political constitution adapted it economical political sway bourgeois class  similar movement going eyes 
Modern bourgeois society relations production exchange property society conjured gigantic means production exchange like sorcerer longer able control powers nether world called spells 
For many decade past history industry commerce history revolt modern productive forces modern conditions production property relations conditions existence bourgeoisie rule 
It enough mention commercial crises periodical return put trial time threateningly existence entire bourgeois society 
In crises great part existing products also previously created productive forces periodically destroyed 
In crises breaks epidemic that earlier epochs would seemed absurditythe epidemic overproduction 
Society suddenly finds put back state momentary barbarism appears famine universal war devastation cut supply every means subsistence industry commerce seem destroyed why 
Because much civilisation much means subsistence much industry much commerce 
The productive forces disposal society longer tend development conditions bourgeois property contrary become powerful conditions fettered soon overcome fetters bring disorder whole bourgeois society endanger existence bourgeois property 
The conditions bourgeois society narrow comprise wealth created them 
And bourgeoisie get crises 
On one hand inforced destruction mass productive forces other conquest new markets thorough exploitation old ones 
That say paving way extensive destructive crises diminishing means whereby crises prevented 
The weapons bourgeoisie felled feudalism ground turned bourgeoisie itself 
But bourgeoisie forged weapons bring death itself also called existence men wield weaponsthe modern working classthe proletarians 
In proportion bourgeoisie ie capital developed proportion proletariat modern working class developeda class labourers live long find work find work long labour increases capital 
These labourers must sell piecemeal commodity like every article commerce consequently exposed vicissitudes competition fluctuations market 
Owing extensive use machinery division labour work proletarians lost individual character consequently charm workman 
He becomes appendage machine simple monotonous easily acquired knack required him 
Hence cost production workman restricted almost entirely means subsistence requires maintenance propagation race 
But price commodity therefore also labour equal cost production 
In proportion therefore repulsiveness work increases wage decreases 
Nay more proportion use machinery division labour increases proportion burden toil also increases whether prolongation working hours increase work exacted given time increased speed machinery etc 
Modern industry converted little workshop patriarchal master great factory industrial capitalist 
Masses labourers crowded factory organised like soldiers 
As privates industrial army placed command perfect hierarchy officers sergeants 
Not slaves bourgeois class bourgeois 
State daily hourly enslaved machine overlooker and all individual bourgeois manufacturer himself 
The openly despotism proclaims gain end aim petty hateful embittering is 
The less skill exertion strength implied manual labour words modern industry becomes developed labour men superseded women 
Differences age sex longer distinctive social validity working class 
All instruments labour less expensive use according age sex 
No sooner exploitation labourer manufacturer far end receives wages cash set upon portions bourgeoisie landlord shopkeeper pawnbroker etc 
The lower strata middle classthe small tradespeople shopkeepers retired tradesmen generally handicraftsmen peasantsall sink gradually proletariat partly diminutive capital suffice scale 
Modern 
Industry carried on swamped competition large capitalists partly specialized skill rendered worthless new methods production 
Thus proletariat recruited classes population 
The proletariat goes various stages development 
With birth begins struggle bourgeoisie 
At first contest carried individual labourers workpeople factory operatives one trade one locality individual bourgeois directly exploits them 
They direct attacks bourgeois conditions production instruments production themselves destroy imported wares compete labour smash pieces machinery set factories ablaze seek restore force vanished status workman 
Middle 
Ages 
At stage labourers still form incoherent mass scattered whole country broken mutual competition 
If anywhere unite form compact bodies yet consequence active union union bourgeoisie class order attain political ends compelled set whole proletariat motion moreover yet time able so 
At stage therefore proletarians fight enemies enemies enemies remnants absolute monarchy landowners nonindustrial bourgeois petty bourgeoisie 
Thus whole historical movement concentrated hands bourgeoisie every victory obtained victory bourgeoisie 
But development industry proletariat increases number becomes concentrated greater masses strength grows feels strength more 
The various interests conditions life within ranks proletariat equalised proportion machinery obliterates distinctions labour nearly everywhere reduces wages low level 
The growing competition among bourgeois resulting commercial crises make wages workers ever fluctuating 
The unceasing improvement machinery ever rapidly developing makes livelihood precarious collisions individual workmen individual bourgeois take character collisions two classes 
Thereupon workers begin form combinations  bourgeois club together order keep rate wages found permanent associations order make provision beforehand occasional revolts 
Here contest breaks riots 
Now workers victorious time 
The real fruit battles lies immediate result everexpanding union workers 
This union helped improved means communication created modern industry place workers different localities contact one another 
It contact needed centralise numerous local struggles character one national struggle classes 
But every class struggle political struggle 
And union attain burghers 
Middle 
Ages miserable highways required centuries modern proletarians thanks railways achieve years 
This organisation proletarians class consequently political party continually upset competition workers themselves 
But ever rises again stronger firmer mightier 
It compels legislative recognition particular interests workers taking advantage divisions among bourgeoisie itself 
Thus tenhours bill 
England carried 
Altogether collisions classes old society further many ways course development proletariat 
The bourgeoisie finds involved constant battle 
At first aristocracy later on portions bourgeoisie itself whose interests become antagonistic progress industry times bourgeoisie foreign countries 
In battles sees compelled appeal proletariat ask help thus drag political arena 
The bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies proletariat instruments political general education words furnishes proletariat weapons fighting bourgeoisie 
Further already seen entire sections ruling classes are advance industry precipitated proletariat least threatened conditions existence 
These also supply proletariat fresh elements enlightenment progress 
Finally times class struggle nears decisive hour process dissolution going within ruling class fact within whole range society assumes violent glaring character small section ruling class cuts adrift joins revolutionary class class holds future hands 
Just as therefore earlier period section nobility went bourgeoisie portion bourgeoisie goes proletariat particular portion bourgeois ideologists raised level comprehending theoretically historical movement whole 
Of classes stand face face bourgeoisie today proletariat alone really revolutionary class 
The classes decay finally disappear face 
Modern 
Industry proletariat special essential product 
The lower middle class small manufacturer shopkeeper artisan peasant fight bourgeoisie save extinction existence fractions middle class 
They therefore revolutionary conservative 
Nay more reactionary try roll back wheel history 
If chance revolutionary view impending transfer proletariat thus defend present future interests desert standpoint place proletariat 
The dangerous class social scum passively rotting mass thrown lowest layers old society may there swept movement proletarian revolution conditions life however prepare far part bribed tool reactionary intrigue 
In conditions proletariat old society large already virtually swamped 
The proletarian without property relation wife children longer anything common bourgeois familyrelations modern industrial labour modern subjection capital 
England 
France 
America 
Germany stripped every trace national character 
Law morality religion many bourgeois prejudices behind lurk ambush many bourgeois interests 
All preceding classes got upper hand sought fortify already acquired status subjecting society large conditions appropriation 
The proletarians cannot become masters productive forces society except abolishing previous mode appropriation thereby also every previous mode appropriation 
They nothing secure fortify mission destroy previous securities for insurances of individual property 
All previous historical movements movements minorities interests minorities 
The proletarian movement selfconscious independent movement immense majority interests immense majority 
The proletariat lowest stratum present society cannot stir cannot raise up without whole superincumbent strata official society sprung air 
Though substance yet form struggle proletariat bourgeoisie first national struggle 
The proletariat country must course first settle matters bourgeoisie 
In depicting general phases development proletariat traced less veiled civil war raging within existing society point war breaks open revolution violent overthrow bourgeoisie lays foundation sway proletariat 
Hitherto every form society based already seen antagonism oppressing oppressed classes 
But order oppress class certain conditions must assured can least continue slavish existence 
The serf period serfdom raised membership commune petty bourgeois yoke feudal absolutism managed develop bourgeois 
The modern laborer contrary instead rising progress industry sinks deeper deeper conditions existence class 
He becomes pauper pauperism develops rapidly population wealth 
And becomes evident bourgeoisie unfit longer ruling class society impose conditions existence upon society overriding law 
It unfit rule incompetent assure existence slave within slavery cannot help letting sink state feed him instead fed him 
Society longer live bourgeoisie words existence longer compatible society 
The essential condition existence sway bourgeois class formation augmentation capital condition capital wagelabour 
Wagelabour rests exclusively competition laborers 
The advance industry whose involuntary promoter bourgeoisie replaces isolation labourers due competition revolutionary combination due association 
The development 
Modern 
Industry therefore cuts feet foundation bourgeoisie produces appropriates products 
What bourgeoisie therefore produces all gravediggers 
Its fall victory proletariat equally inevitable     
In relation 
Communists stand proletarians whole 
The 
Communists form separate party opposed workingclass parties 
They interests separate apart proletariat whole 
They set sectarian principles own shape mould proletarian movement 
The 
Communists distinguished workingclass parties only  
In national struggles proletarians different countries point bring front common interests entire proletariat independently nationality  
In various stages development struggle working class bourgeoisie pass through always everywhere represent interests movement whole 
The 
Communists therefore one hand practically advanced resolute section workingclass parties every country section pushes forward others hand theoretically great mass proletariat advantage clearly understanding line march conditions ultimate general results proletarian movement 
The immediate aim 
Communist proletarian parties formation proletariat class overthrow bourgeois supremacy conquest political power proletariat 
The theoretical conclusions 
Communists way based ideas principles invented discovered wouldbe universal reformer 
They merely express general terms actual relations springing existing class struggle historical movement going eyes 
The abolition existing property relations distinctive feature 
Communism 
All property relations past continually subject historical change consequent upon change historical conditions 
The 
French 
Revolution example abolished feudal property favour bourgeois property 
The distinguishing feature 
Communism abolition property generally abolition bourgeois property 
But modern bourgeois private property final complete expression system producing appropriating products based class antagonisms exploitation many few 
In sense theory 
Communists may summed single sentence 
Abolition private property 
We 
Communists reproached desire abolishing right personally acquiring property fruit mans labour property alleged groundwork personal freedom activity independence 
Hardwon selfacquired selfearned property 
Do mean property petty artisan small peasant form property preceded bourgeois form 
There need abolish that development industry great extent already destroyed it still destroying daily 
Or mean modern bourgeois private property 
But wagelabour create property labourer 
Not bit 
It creates capital ie kind property exploits wagelabour cannot increase except upon condition begetting new supply wagelabour fresh exploitation 
Property present form based antagonism capital wagelabour 
Let us examine sides antagonism 
To capitalist purely personal social status production 
Capital collective product united action many members nay last resort united action members society set motion 
Capital is therefore personal social power 
When therefore capital converted common property property members society personal property thereby transformed social property 
It social character property changed 
It loses classcharacter 
Let us take wagelabour 
The average price wagelabour minimum wage ie quantum means subsistence absolutely requisite bare existence labourer 
What therefore wagelabourer appropriates means labour merely suffices prolong reproduce bare existence 
We means intend abolish personal appropriation products labour appropriation made maintenance reproduction human life leaves surplus wherewith command labour others 
All want away with miserable character appropriation labourer lives merely increase capital allowed live far interest ruling class requires it 
In bourgeois society living labour means increase accumulated labour 
In 
Communist society accumulated labour means widen enrich promote existence labourer 
In bourgeois society therefore past dominates present 
Communist society present dominates past 
In bourgeois society capital independent individuality living person dependent individuality 
And abolition state things called bourgeois abolition individuality freedom 
And rightly so 
The abolition bourgeois individuality bourgeois independence bourgeois freedom undoubtedly aimed at 
By freedom meant present bourgeois conditions production free trade free selling buying 
But selling buying disappears free selling buying disappears also 
This talk free selling buying brave words bourgeoisie freedom general meaning any contrast restricted selling buying fettered traders 
Middle 
Ages meaning opposed 
Communistic abolition buying selling bourgeois conditions production bourgeoisie itself 
You horrified intending away private property 
But existing society private property already done away ninetenths population existence solely due nonexistence hands ninetenths 
You reproach us therefore intending away form property necessary condition whose existence nonexistence property immense majority society 
In one word reproach us intending away property 
Precisely so intend 
From moment labour longer converted capital money rent social power capable monopolised ie moment individual property longer transformed bourgeois property capital moment say individuality vanishes 
You must therefore confess individual mean person bourgeois middleclass owner property 
This person must indeed swept way made impossible 
Communism deprives man power appropriate products society deprive power subjugate labour others means appropriation 
It objected upon abolition private property work cease universal laziness overtake us 
According this bourgeois society ought long ago gone dogs sheer idleness members work acquire nothing acquire anything work 
The whole objection another expression tautology longer wagelabour longer capital 
All objections urged 
Communistic mode producing appropriating material products have way urged 
Communistic modes producing appropriating intellectual products 
Just as bourgeois disappearance class property disappearance production itself disappearance class culture identical disappearance culture 
That culture loss laments is enormous majority mere training act machine 
But wrangle us long apply intended abolition bourgeois property standard bourgeois notions freedom culture law etc 
Your ideas outgrowth conditions bourgeois production bourgeois property jurisprudence class made law all will whose essential character direction determined economical conditions existence class 
The selfish misconception induces transform eternal laws nature reason social forms springing present mode production form propertyhistorical relations rise disappear progress productionthis misconception share every ruling class preceded you 
What see clearly case ancient property admit case feudal property course forbidden admit case bourgeois form property 
Abolition family 
Even radical flare infamous proposal 
Communists 
On foundation present family bourgeois family based 
On capital private gain 
In completely developed form family exists among bourgeoisie 
But state things finds complement practical absence family among proletarians public prostitution 
The bourgeois family vanish matter course complement vanishes vanish vanishing capital 
Do charge us wanting stop exploitation children parents 
To crime plead guilty 
But say destroy hallowed relations replace home education social 
And education 
Is also social determined social conditions educate intervention direct indirect society means schools etc 
The 
Communists invented intervention society education seek alter character intervention rescue education influence ruling class 
The bourgeois claptrap family education hallowed corelation parent child becomes disgusting more action 
Modern 
Industry family ties among proletarians torn asunder children transformed simple articles commerce instruments labour 
But 
Communists would introduce community women screams whole bourgeoisie chorus 
The bourgeois sees wife mere instrument production 
He hears instruments production exploited common and naturally come conclusion lot common likewise fall women 
He even suspicion real point away status women mere instruments production 
For rest nothing ridiculous virtuous indignation bourgeois community women which pretend openly officially established 
Communists 
The 
Communists need introduce community women existed almost time immemorial 
Our bourgeois content wives daughters proletarians disposal speak common prostitutes take greatest pleasure seducing others wives 
Bourgeois marriage reality system wives common thus most 
Communists might possibly reproached with desire introduce substitution hypocritically concealed openly legalised community women 
For rest selfevident abolition present system production must bring abolition community women springing system ie prostitution public private 
The 
Communists reproached desiring abolish countries nationality 
The working men country 
We cannot take got 
Since proletariat must first acquire political supremacy must rise leading class nation must constitute nation is far national though bourgeois sense word 
National differences antagonisms peoples daily vanishing owing development bourgeoisie freedom commerce worldmarket uniformity mode production conditions life corresponding thereto 
The supremacy proletariat cause vanish still faster 
United action leading civilised countries least one first conditions emancipation proletariat 
In proportion exploitation one individual another put end to exploitation one nation another also put end to 
In proportion antagonism classes within nation vanishes hostility one nation another come end 
The charges 
Communism made religious philosophical and generally ideological standpoint deserving serious examination 
Does require deep intuition comprehend mans ideas views conceptions one word mans consciousness changes every change conditions material existence social relations social life 
What else history ideas prove intellectual production changes character proportion material production changed 
The ruling ideas age ever ideas ruling class 
When people speak ideas revolutionise society express fact within old society elements new one created dissolution old ideas keeps even pace dissolution old conditions existence 
When ancient world last throes ancient religions overcome 
Christianity 
When 
Christian ideas succumbed th century rationalist ideas feudal society fought death battle revolutionary bourgeoisie 
The ideas religious liberty freedom conscience merely gave expression sway free competition within domain knowledge 
Undoubtedly said religious moral philosophical juridical ideas modified course historical development 
But religion morality philosophy political science law constantly survived change 
There are besides eternal truths 
Freedom 
Justice etc common states society 
But 
Communism abolishes eternal truths abolishes religion morality instead constituting new basis therefore acts contradiction past historical experience 
What accusation reduce to 
The history past society consisted development class antagonisms antagonisms assumed different forms different epochs 
But whatever form may taken one fact common past ages viz exploitation one part society other 
No wonder then social consciousness past ages despite multiplicity variety displays moves within certain common forms general ideas cannot completely vanish except total disappearance class antagonisms 
The 
Communist revolution radical rupture traditional property relations wonder development involves radical rupture traditional ideas 
But let us done bourgeois objections 
Communism 
We seen above first step revolution working class raise proletariat position ruling win battle democracy 
The proletariat use political supremacy wrest degrees capital bourgeoisie centralise instruments production hands 
State ie proletariat organised ruling class increase total productive forces rapidly possible 
Of course beginning cannot effected except means despotic inroads rights property conditions bourgeois production means measures therefore appear economically insufficient untenable which course movement outstrip themselves necessitate inroads upon old social order unavoidable means entirely revolutionising mode production 
These measures course different different countries 
Nevertheless advanced countries following pretty generally applicable  
Abolition property land application rents land public purposes   heavy progressive graduated income tax  
Abolition right inheritance  
Confiscation property emigrants rebels  
Centralisation credit hands 
State means national bank 
State capital exclusive monopoly  
Centralisation means communication transport hands 
State  
Extension factories instruments production owned 
State bringing cultivation wastelands improvement soil generally accordance common plan  
Equal liability labour 
Establishment industrial armies especially agriculture  
Combination agriculture manufacturing industries gradual abolition distinction town country equable distribution population country  
Free education children public schools 
Abolition childrens factory labour present form 
Combination education industrial production c c 
When course development class distinctions disappeared production concentrated hands vast association whole nation public power lose political character 
Political power properly called merely organised power one class oppressing another 
If proletariat contest bourgeoisie compelled force circumstances organise class if means revolution makes ruling class and such sweeps away force old conditions production will along conditions swept away conditions existence class antagonisms classes generally thereby abolished supremacy class 
In place old bourgeois society classes class antagonisms shall association free development condition free development all

Thus aristocracy took revenge singing lampoons new master whispering ears sinister prophecies coming catastrophe 
In way arose

In showing that rule modern proletariat never existed forget modern bourgeoisie necessary offspring form society 
For rest little conceal reactionary character criticism chief accusation bourgeoisie amounts this bourgeois regime class developed destined cut root branch old order society

Socialism 
The feudal aristocracy class ruined bourgeoisie class whose conditions existence pined perished atmosphere modern bourgeois society 
The mediaeval burgesses small peasant proprietors precursors modern bourgeoisie 
In countries little developed industrially commercially two classes still vegetate side side rising bourgeoisie 
In countries modern civilisation become fully developed new class petty bourgeois formed fluctuating proletariat bourgeoisie ever renewing supplementary part bourgeois society 
The individual members class however constantly hurled proletariat action competition and modern industry develops even see moment approaching completely disappear independent section modern society replaced manufactures agriculture commerce overlookers bailiffs shopmen 
In countries like 
France peasants constitute far half population natural writers sided proletariat bourgeoisie use criticism bourgeois regime standard peasant petty bourgeois standpoint intermediate classes take cudgels working class 
Thus arose pettybourgeois

It laid bare hypocritical apologies economists 
It proved incontrovertibly disastrous effects machinery division labour concentration capital land hands overproduction crises pointed inevitable ruin petty bourgeois peasant misery proletariat anarchy production crying inequalities distribution wealth industrial war extermination nations dissolution old moral bonds old family relations old nationalities 
In positive aims however form 
Socialism aspires either restoring old means production exchange old property relations old society cramping modern means production exchange within framework old property relations been bound be exploded means 
In either case reactionary

This form

We may cite 
Proudhons 
Philosophie de la 
Misere example form 
The 
Socialistic bourgeois want advantages modern social conditions without struggles dangers necessarily resulting therefrom 
They desire existing state society minus revolutionary disintegrating elements 
They wish bourgeoisie without proletariat 
The bourgeoisie naturally conceives world supreme best bourgeois 
Socialism develops comfortable conception various less complete systems 
In requiring proletariat carry system thereby march straightway social 
New 
Jerusalem requires reality proletariat remain within bounds existing society cast away hateful ideas concerning bourgeoisie  second practical less systematic form 
Socialism sought depreciate every revolutionary movement eyes working class showing mere political reform change material conditions existence economic relations could advantage them 
By changes material conditions existence form 
Socialism however means understands abolition bourgeois relations production abolition effected revolution administrative reforms based continued existence relations reforms therefore respect affect relations capital labour but best lessen cost simplify administrative work bourgeois government 
Bourgeois 
Socialism attains adequate expression when when becomes mere figure speech 
Free trade benefit working class 
Protective duties benefit working class 
Prison 
Reform benefit working class 
This last word seriously meant word bourgeois 
Socialism 
It summed phrase bourgeois bourgeoisfor benefit working class      
We refer literature which every great modern revolution always given voice demands proletariat writings 
Babeuf others 
The first direct attempts proletariat attain ends made times universal excitement feudal society overthrown attempts necessarily failed owing undeveloped state proletariat well absence economic conditions emancipation conditions yet produced could produced impending bourgeois epoch alone 
The revolutionary literature accompanied first movements proletariat necessarily reactionary character 
It inculcated universal asceticism social levelling crudest form 
The 
Socialist 
Communist systems properly called 
Saint
Simon 
Fourier 
Owen others spring existence early undeveloped period described above struggle proletariat bourgeoisie  
The founders systems see indeed class antagonisms well action decomposing elements prevailing form society 
But proletariat yet infancy offers spectacle class without historical initiative independent political movement 
Since development class antagonism keeps even pace development industry economic situation find it yet offer material conditions emancipation proletariat 
They therefore search new social science new social laws create conditions 
Historical action yield personal inventive action historically created conditions emancipation fantastic ones gradual spontaneous classorganisation proletariat organisation society specially contrived inventors 
Future history resolves itself eyes propaganda practical carrying social plans 
In formation plans conscious caring chiefly interests working class suffering class 
Only point view suffering class proletariat exist them 
The undeveloped state class struggle well surroundings causes 
Socialists kind consider far superior class antagonisms 
They want improve condition every member society even favoured 
Hence habitually appeal society large without distinction class nay preference ruling class 
For people understand system fail see best possible plan best possible state society 
Hence reject political especially revolutionary action wish attain ends peaceful means endeavour small experiments necessarily doomed failure force example pave way new social
