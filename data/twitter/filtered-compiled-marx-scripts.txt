Unless writer artist, know, catch bed cashier... That's fair. You looked twice me. It someone does, is. And even know I am. Did ever give chance? I'm giving right now. All right. Who you? What? I still know are. I know not. Who Howard Prince? Hey, Florence, I got tell you, know, easy love you. You know why? Because looking time is, like, knight horse something, Howard Prince. You know Howard Prince is? I'll tell you. Howard Prince man. What mean? Well, I think going find I come back committee tomorrow. What I going find? Page 62/69 You said fixed. Well, I've thinking it. You know, everybody's telling do. But, know, I see I to. What going do? Well, I'll work something out. Are going tell writer? I'm going tell exactly I want tell them. Howard, committee dangerous. They're blood. You can't fool around. Take word it. All people, Allie Sussman everything, they're wrong, I beat committee, I beat way. How? Hey, what's difference? I'm telling you, I'm going wind back cash register. Take word it. And I'm going anything makes ashamed me. Trust me. Can trust me? And would like thank committee allowing Mr. Prince appear voice approval great work country. Communist subversion Page 63/69 real present danger, rest assured never tolerated network Mr. Prince I honor represent. Thank you. Thank much. Thank you, sir. This committee help keep America pure possibly make it. Well, I can't think anything important. Well, I would like commend committee job they're doing. Thank you. Counsel... Just questions, Mr. Prince. We know busy man. Mr. Prince, happen know Alfred Miller? Who'? Alfred Miller. Why? If tell committee... So I can't know why? Mr. Prince, worry. Anyone comes tells truth got nothing worry about. Which Alfred Miller? Do know Alfred Miller, writer? Uh, say "know," uh... know, ever really know person? Page 64/69 I think, know- I grew Alfred Miller, I know him? Would say, I know him? Can know- In biblical sense, know him? Am I right? Would Alfred Miller met several times Hammer's Dairy Restaurant? Who says I did? Is true? No, I asked first. Is true? I understand. Is anybody accusing anything? If would answer question... Which question? You asked one question. I answered question, then- Do know Alfred Miller? You already asked question. Howard, doing? What mean? I'm handling it. Don't worry. You're oath. If answer, hold contempt. Well, I answering. I'm replying, that's all. Oh, split hairs. But get I answer. If I answer without replying, I got them. But getting mad. So what? What do, throw out? Do know Alfred Miller? Page 65/69 Hey, guys aware fact every week, busloads communists coming border? I mean, anybody anything that? We concerned time anything communist conspiracy entertainment world. But come? Why something it? I mean, everybody armed? You know, everybody learn use gun. I think big mistake anyone goes military school- You send they're bad. Mr. Prince, committee concerned threat communism are. Since memory unclear Alfred Miller, know people? William Phelps... Herbert Delaney... Florence Barrett... Hershel Brownstein, also known Hecky Brown? He's dead. Did know him? Mr. Prince... Now, came cooperate today, not? Will excuse us moment, Page 66/69 Mr. Prince? John. I thought arrangement. With network. I think he's himself. Why hit contempt? He's giving us grounds. We can't let get away this. He even taken amendment. There's got something nail on. Okay- Mr. Prince, let ask another question. Do know Patrick Callahan? Who'? Bartender Friendly Tavern, where, I believe, worked night cashier. I did? Do know Daniel LaGattuta? Doesn't sell fruit? You placed bets Mr. Callahan Mr. LaGattuta, not? In... In a- In strictly friendly way. I remind placing bets crime. Howard, true? You bookmaker? Not professionally. Oh, God.

Yes, ready, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Prince, I ask you, record, know Hershel Brownstein? Howard, go jail. Also known Hecky Brown? Be practical. Did know man either Brown Brownstein? Either name do, Mr. Prince. Tell them. Brown Brownstein? Just name. Are refusing answer? Will talk? Fellows... I recognize right committee ask kind questions. And, furthermore, go fuck yourselves.

At heart A spectre haunting Europe--the spectre Communism. All Powers old Europe entered holy alliance exorcise spectre: Pope Czar, Metternich Guizot, French Radicals German police-spies. Where party opposition decried Communistic opponents power? Where Opposition hurled back branding reproach Communism, advanced opposition parties, well reactionary adversaries? Two things result fact. I. Communism already acknowledged European Powers Power. II. It high time Communists openly, face whole world, publish views, aims, tendencies, meet nursery tale Spectre Communism Manifesto party itself. To end, Communists various nationalities assembled London, sketched following Manifesto, published English, French, German, Italian, Flemish Danish languages. I. BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS The history hitherto existing societies history class struggles. Freeman slave, patrician plebeian, lord serf, guild-master journeyman, word, oppressor oppressed, stood constant opposition one another, carried uninterrupted, hidden, open fight, fight time ended, either revolutionary re-constitution society large, common ruin contending classes. In earlier epochs history, find almost everywhere complicated arrangement society various orders, manifold gradation social rank. In ancient Rome patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; almost classes, again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois society sprouted ruins feudal society done away class antagonisms. It established new classes, new conditions oppression, new forms struggle place old ones. Our epoch, epoch bourgeoisie, possesses, however, distinctive feature: simplified class antagonisms. Society whole splitting two great hostile camps, two great classes, directly facing other: Bourgeoisie Proletariat. From serfs Middle Ages sprang chartered burghers earliest towns. From burgesses first elements bourgeoisie developed. The discovery America, rounding Cape, opened fresh ground rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian Chinese markets, colonisation America, trade colonies, increase means exchange commodities generally, gave commerce, navigation, industry, impulse never known, thereby, revolutionary element tottering feudal society, rapid development. The feudal system industry, industrial production monopolised closed guilds, longer sufficed growing wants new markets. The manufacturing system took place. The guild-masters pushed one side manufacturing middle class; division labour different corporate guilds vanished face division labour single workshop. Meantime markets kept ever growing, demand ever rising. Even manufacture longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place manufacture taken giant, Modern Industry, place industrial middle class, industrial millionaires, leaders whole industrial armies, modern bourgeois. Modern industry established world-market, discovery America paved way. This market given immense development commerce, navigation, communication land. This development has, time, reacted extension industry; proportion industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, proportion bourgeoisie developed, increased capital, pushed background every class handed Middle Ages. We see, therefore, modern bourgeoisie product long course development, series revolutions modes production exchange. Each step development bourgeoisie accompanied corresponding political advance class. An oppressed class sway feudal nobility, armed self-governing association mediaeval commune; independent urban republic (as Italy Germany), taxable "third estate" monarchy (as France), afterwards, period manufacture proper, serving either semi-feudal absolute monarchy counterpoise nobility, and, fact, corner-stone great monarchies general, bourgeoisie last, since establishment Modern Industry world-market, conquered itself, modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive modern State committee managing common affairs whole bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie, historically, played revolutionary part. The bourgeoisie, wherever got upper hand, put end feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It pitilessly torn asunder motley feudal ties bound man "natural superiors," left remaining nexus man man naked self-interest, callous "cash payment." It drowned heavenly ecstasies religious fervour, chivalrous enthusiasm, philistine sentimentalism, icy water egotistical calculation. It resolved personal worth exchange value, place numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, set single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade. In one word, exploitation, veiled religious political illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. The bourgeoisie stripped halo every occupation hitherto honoured looked reverent awe. It converted physician, lawyer, priest, poet, man science, paid wage labourers. The bourgeoisie torn away family sentimental veil, reduced family relation mere money relation. The bourgeoisie disclosed came pass brutal display vigour Middle Ages, Reactionists much admire, found fitting complement slothful indolence. It first show man's activity bring about. It accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals; conducted expeditions put shade former Exoduses nations crusades. The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising instruments production, thereby relations production, whole relations society. Conservation old modes production unaltered form, was, contrary, first condition existence earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising production, uninterrupted disturbance social conditions, everlasting uncertainty agitation distinguish bourgeois epoch earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, train ancient venerable prejudices opinions, swept away, new-formed ones become antiquated ossify. All solid melts air, holy profaned, man last compelled face sober senses, real conditions life, relations kind. The need constantly expanding market products chases bourgeoisie whole surface globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere. The bourgeoisie exploitation world-market given cosmopolitan character production consumption every country. To great chagrin Reactionists, drawn feet industry national ground stood. All old-established national industries destroyed daily destroyed. They dislodged new industries, whose introduction becomes life death question civilised nations, industries longer work indigenous raw material, raw material drawn remotest zones; industries whose products consumed, home, every quarter globe. In place old wants, satisfied productions country, find new wants, requiring satisfaction products distant lands climes. In place old local national seclusion self-sufficiency, intercourse every direction, universal inter-dependence nations. And material, also intellectual production. The intellectual creations individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness narrow-mindedness become impossible, numerous national local literatures, arises world literature. The bourgeoisie, rapid improvement instruments production, immensely facilitated means communication, draws all, even barbarian, nations civilisation. The cheap prices commodities heavy artillery batters Chinese walls, forces barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred foreigners capitulate. It compels nations, pain extinction, adopt bourgeois mode production; compels introduce calls civilisation midst, i.e., become bourgeois themselves. In one word, creates world image. The bourgeoisie subjected country rule towns. It created enormous cities, greatly increased urban population compared rural, thus rescued considerable part population idiocy rural life. Just made country dependent towns, made barbarian semi-barbarian countries dependent civilised ones, nations peasants nations bourgeois, East West. The bourgeoisie keeps away scattered state population, means production, property. It agglomerated production, concentrated property hands. The necessary consequence political centralisation. Independent, loosely connected provinces, separate interests, laws, governments systems taxation, became lumped together one nation, one government, one code laws, one national class-interest, one frontier one customs-tariff. The bourgeoisie, rule scarce one hundred years, created massive colossal productive forces preceding generations together. Subjection Nature's forces man, machinery, application chemistry industry agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing whole continents cultivation, canalisation rivers, whole populations conjured ground--what earlier century even presentiment productive forces slumbered lap social labour? We see then: means production exchange, whose foundation bourgeoisie built up, generated feudal society. At certain stage development means production exchange, conditions feudal society produced exchanged, feudal organisation agriculture manufacturing industry, one word, feudal relations property became longer compatible already developed productive forces; became many fetters. They burst asunder; burst asunder. Into place stepped free competition, accompanied social political constitution adapted it, economical political sway bourgeois class. A similar movement going eyes. Modern bourgeois society relations production, exchange property, society conjured gigantic means production exchange, like sorcerer, longer able control powers nether world called spells. For many decade past history industry commerce history revolt modern productive forces modern conditions production, property relations conditions existence bourgeoisie rule. It enough mention commercial crises periodical return put trial, time threateningly, existence entire bourgeois society. In crises great part existing products, also previously created productive forces, periodically destroyed. In crises breaks epidemic that, earlier epochs, would seemed absurdity--the epidemic over-production. Society suddenly finds put back state momentary barbarism; appears famine, universal war devastation cut supply every means subsistence; industry commerce seem destroyed; why? Because much civilisation, much means subsistence, much industry, much commerce. The productive forces disposal society longer tend development conditions bourgeois property; contrary, become powerful conditions, fettered, soon overcome fetters, bring disorder whole bourgeois society, endanger existence bourgeois property. The conditions bourgeois society narrow comprise wealth created them. And bourgeoisie get crises? On one hand inforced destruction mass productive forces; other, conquest new markets, thorough exploitation old ones. That say, paving way extensive destructive crises, diminishing means whereby crises prevented. The weapons bourgeoisie felled feudalism ground turned bourgeoisie itself. But bourgeoisie forged weapons bring death itself; also called existence men wield weapons--the modern working class--the proletarians. In proportion bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, developed, proportion proletariat, modern working class, developed--a class labourers, live long find work, find work long labour increases capital. These labourers, must sell piece-meal, commodity, like every article commerce, consequently exposed vicissitudes competition, fluctuations market. Owing extensive use machinery division labour, work proletarians lost individual character, consequently, charm workman. He becomes appendage machine, simple, monotonous, easily acquired knack, required him. Hence, cost production workman restricted, almost entirely, means subsistence requires maintenance, propagation race. But price commodity, therefore also labour, equal cost production. In proportion therefore, repulsiveness work increases, wage decreases. Nay more, proportion use machinery division labour increases, proportion burden toil also increases, whether prolongation working hours, increase work exacted given time increased speed machinery, etc. Modern industry converted little workshop patriarchal master great factory industrial capitalist. Masses labourers, crowded factory, organised like soldiers. As privates industrial army placed command perfect hierarchy officers sergeants. Not slaves bourgeois class, bourgeois State; daily hourly enslaved machine, over-looker, and, all, individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The openly despotism proclaims gain end aim, petty, hateful embittering is. The less skill exertion strength implied manual labour, words, modern industry becomes developed, labour men superseded women. Differences age sex longer distinctive social validity working class. All instruments labour, less expensive use, according age sex. No sooner exploitation labourer manufacturer, far end, receives wages cash, set upon portions bourgeoisie, landlord, shopkeeper, pawnbroker, etc. The lower strata middle class--the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, handicraftsmen peasants--all sink gradually proletariat, partly diminutive capital suffice scale Modern Industry carried on, swamped competition large capitalists, partly specialized skill rendered worthless new methods production. Thus proletariat recruited classes population. The proletariat goes various stages development. With birth begins struggle bourgeoisie. At first contest carried individual labourers, workpeople factory, operatives one trade, one locality, individual bourgeois directly exploits them. They direct attacks bourgeois conditions production, instruments production themselves; destroy imported wares compete labour, smash pieces machinery, set factories ablaze, seek restore force vanished status workman Middle Ages. At stage labourers still form incoherent mass scattered whole country, broken mutual competition. If anywhere unite form compact bodies, yet consequence active union, union bourgeoisie, class, order attain political ends, compelled set whole proletariat motion, moreover yet, time, able so. At stage, therefore, proletarians fight enemies, enemies enemies, remnants absolute monarchy, landowners, non-industrial bourgeois, petty bourgeoisie. Thus whole historical movement concentrated hands bourgeoisie; every victory obtained victory bourgeoisie. But development industry proletariat increases number; becomes concentrated greater masses, strength grows, feels strength more. The various interests conditions life within ranks proletariat equalised, proportion machinery obliterates distinctions labour, nearly everywhere reduces wages low level. The growing competition among bourgeois, resulting commercial crises, make wages workers ever fluctuating. The unceasing improvement machinery, ever rapidly developing, makes livelihood precarious; collisions individual workmen individual bourgeois take character collisions two classes. Thereupon workers begin form combinations (Trades Unions) bourgeois; club together order keep rate wages; found permanent associations order make provision beforehand occasional revolts. Here contest breaks riots. Now workers victorious, time. The real fruit battles lies, immediate result, ever-expanding union workers. This union helped improved means communication created modern industry place workers different localities contact one another. It contact needed centralise numerous local struggles, character, one national struggle classes. But every class struggle political struggle. And union, attain burghers Middle Ages, miserable highways, required centuries, modern proletarians, thanks railways, achieve years. This organisation proletarians class, consequently political party, continually upset competition workers themselves. But ever rises again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition particular interests workers, taking advantage divisions among bourgeoisie itself. Thus ten-hours' bill England carried. Altogether collisions classes old society further, many ways, course development proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds involved constant battle. At first aristocracy; later on, portions bourgeoisie itself, whose interests become antagonistic progress industry; times, bourgeoisie foreign countries. In battles sees compelled appeal proletariat, ask help, thus, drag political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies proletariat instruments political general education, words, furnishes proletariat weapons fighting bourgeoisie. Further, already seen, entire sections ruling classes are, advance industry, precipitated proletariat, least threatened conditions existence. These also supply proletariat fresh elements enlightenment progress. Finally, times class struggle nears decisive hour, process dissolution going within ruling class, fact within whole range society, assumes violent, glaring character, small section ruling class cuts adrift, joins revolutionary class, class holds future hands. Just as, therefore, earlier period, section nobility went bourgeoisie, portion bourgeoisie goes proletariat, particular, portion bourgeois ideologists, raised level comprehending theoretically historical movement whole. Of classes stand face face bourgeoisie today, proletariat alone really revolutionary class. The classes decay finally disappear face Modern Industry; proletariat special essential product. The lower middle class, small manufacturer, shopkeeper, artisan, peasant, fight bourgeoisie, save extinction existence fractions middle class. They therefore revolutionary, conservative. Nay more, reactionary, try roll back wheel history. If chance revolutionary, view impending transfer proletariat, thus defend present, future interests, desert standpoint place proletariat. The "dangerous class," social scum, passively rotting mass thrown lowest layers old society, may, there, swept movement proletarian revolution; conditions life, however, prepare far part bribed tool reactionary intrigue. In conditions proletariat, old society large already virtually swamped. The proletarian without property; relation wife children longer anything common bourgeois family-relations; modern industrial labour, modern subjection capital, England France, America Germany, stripped every trace national character. Law, morality, religion, many bourgeois prejudices, behind lurk ambush many bourgeois interests. All preceding classes got upper hand, sought fortify already acquired status subjecting society large conditions appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters productive forces society, except abolishing previous mode appropriation, thereby also every previous mode appropriation. They nothing secure fortify; mission destroy previous securities for, insurances of, individual property. All previous historical movements movements minorities, interests minorities. The proletarian movement self-conscious, independent movement immense majority, interests immense majority. The proletariat, lowest stratum present society, cannot stir, cannot raise up, without whole superincumbent strata official society sprung air. Though substance, yet form, struggle proletariat bourgeoisie first national struggle. The proletariat country must, course, first settle matters bourgeoisie. In depicting general phases development proletariat, traced less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, point war breaks open revolution, violent overthrow bourgeoisie lays foundation sway proletariat. Hitherto, every form society based, already seen, antagonism oppressing oppressed classes. But order oppress class, certain conditions must assured can, least, continue slavish existence. The serf, period serfdom, raised membership commune, petty bourgeois, yoke feudal absolutism, managed develop bourgeois. The modern laborer, contrary, instead rising progress industry, sinks deeper deeper conditions existence class. He becomes pauper, pauperism develops rapidly population wealth. And becomes evident, bourgeoisie unfit longer ruling class society, impose conditions existence upon society over-riding law. It unfit rule incompetent assure existence slave within slavery, cannot help letting sink state, feed him, instead fed him. Society longer live bourgeoisie, words, existence longer compatible society. The essential condition existence, sway bourgeois class, formation augmentation capital; condition capital wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively competition laborers. The advance industry, whose involuntary promoter bourgeoisie, replaces isolation labourers, due competition, revolutionary combination, due association. The development Modern Industry, therefore, cuts feet foundation bourgeoisie produces appropriates products. What bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, all, grave-diggers. Its fall victory proletariat equally inevitable. II. PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS In relation Communists stand proletarians whole? The Communists form separate party opposed working-class parties. They interests separate apart proletariat whole. They set sectarian principles own, shape mould proletarian movement. The Communists distinguished working-class parties only: (1) In national struggles proletarians different countries, point bring front common interests entire proletariat, independently nationality. (2) In various stages development struggle working class bourgeoisie pass through, always everywhere represent interests movement whole. The Communists, therefore, one hand, practically, advanced resolute section working-class parties every country, section pushes forward others; hand, theoretically, great mass proletariat advantage clearly understanding line march, conditions, ultimate general results proletarian movement. The immediate aim Communist proletarian parties: formation proletariat class, overthrow bourgeois supremacy, conquest political power proletariat. The theoretical conclusions Communists way based ideas principles invented, discovered, would-be universal reformer. They merely express, general terms, actual relations springing existing class struggle, historical movement going eyes. The abolition existing property relations distinctive feature Communism. All property relations past continually subject historical change consequent upon change historical conditions. The French Revolution, example, abolished feudal property favour bourgeois property. The distinguishing feature Communism abolition property generally, abolition bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property final complete expression system producing appropriating products, based class antagonisms, exploitation many few. In sense, theory Communists may summed single sentence: Abolition private property. We Communists reproached desire abolishing right personally acquiring property fruit man's labour, property alleged groundwork personal freedom, activity independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do mean property petty artisan small peasant, form property preceded bourgeois form? There need abolish that; development industry great extent already destroyed it, still destroying daily. Or mean modern bourgeois private property? But wage-labour create property labourer? Not bit. It creates capital, i.e., kind property exploits wage-labour, cannot increase except upon condition begetting new supply wage-labour fresh exploitation. Property, present form, based antagonism capital wage-labour. Let us examine sides antagonism. To capitalist, purely personal, social status production. Capital collective product, united action many members, nay, last resort, united action members society, set motion. Capital is, therefore, personal, social power. When, therefore, capital converted common property, property members society, personal property thereby transformed social property. It social character property changed. It loses class-character. Let us take wage-labour. The average price wage-labour minimum wage, i.e., quantum means subsistence, absolutely requisite bare existence labourer. What, therefore, wage-labourer appropriates means labour, merely suffices prolong reproduce bare existence. We means intend abolish personal appropriation products labour, appropriation made maintenance reproduction human life, leaves surplus wherewith command labour others. All want away with, miserable character appropriation, labourer lives merely increase capital, allowed live far interest ruling class requires it. In bourgeois society, living labour means increase accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour means widen, enrich, promote existence labourer. In bourgeois society, therefore, past dominates present; Communist society, present dominates past. In bourgeois society capital independent individuality, living person dependent individuality. And abolition state things called bourgeois, abolition individuality freedom! And rightly so. The abolition bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, bourgeois freedom undoubtedly aimed at. By freedom meant, present bourgeois conditions production, free trade, free selling buying. But selling buying disappears, free selling buying disappears also. This talk free selling buying, "brave words" bourgeoisie freedom general, meaning, any, contrast restricted selling buying, fettered traders Middle Ages, meaning opposed Communistic abolition buying selling, bourgeois conditions production, bourgeoisie itself. You horrified intending away private property. But existing society, private property already done away nine-tenths population; existence solely due non-existence hands nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, intending away form property, necessary condition whose existence non-existence property immense majority society. In one word, reproach us intending away property. Precisely so; intend. From moment labour longer converted capital, money, rent, social power capable monopolised, i.e., moment individual property longer transformed bourgeois property, capital, moment, say individuality vanishes. You must, therefore, confess "individual" mean person bourgeois, middle-class owner property. This person must, indeed, swept way, made impossible. Communism deprives man power appropriate products society; deprive power subjugate labour others means appropriation. It objected upon abolition private property work cease, universal laziness overtake us. According this, bourgeois society ought long ago gone dogs sheer idleness; members work, acquire nothing, acquire anything, work. The whole objection another expression tautology: longer wage-labour longer capital. All objections urged Communistic mode producing appropriating material products, have, way, urged Communistic modes producing appropriating intellectual products. Just as, bourgeois, disappearance class property disappearance production itself, disappearance class culture identical disappearance culture. That culture, loss laments, is, enormous majority, mere training act machine. But wrangle us long apply, intended abolition bourgeois property, standard bourgeois notions freedom, culture, law, etc. Your ideas outgrowth conditions bourgeois production bourgeois property, jurisprudence class made law all, will, whose essential character direction determined economical conditions existence class. The selfish misconception induces transform eternal laws nature reason, social forms springing present mode production form property--historical relations rise disappear progress production--this misconception share every ruling class preceded you. What see clearly case ancient property, admit case feudal property, course forbidden admit case bourgeois form property. Abolition family! Even radical flare infamous proposal Communists. On foundation present family, bourgeois family, based? On capital, private gain. In completely developed form family exists among bourgeoisie. But state things finds complement practical absence family among proletarians, public prostitution. The bourgeois family vanish matter course complement vanishes, vanish vanishing capital. Do charge us wanting stop exploitation children parents? To crime plead guilty. But, say, destroy hallowed relations, replace home education social. And education! Is also social, determined social conditions educate, intervention, direct indirect, society, means schools, etc.? The Communists invented intervention society education; seek alter character intervention, rescue education influence ruling class. The bourgeois clap-trap family education, hallowed co-relation parent child, becomes disgusting, more, action Modern Industry, family ties among proletarians torn asunder, children transformed simple articles commerce instruments labour. But Communists would introduce community women, screams whole bourgeoisie chorus. The bourgeois sees wife mere instrument production. He hears instruments production exploited common, and, naturally, come conclusion lot common likewise fall women. He even suspicion real point away status women mere instruments production. For rest, nothing ridiculous virtuous indignation bourgeois community women which, pretend, openly officially established Communists. The Communists need introduce community women; existed almost time immemorial. Our bourgeois, content wives daughters proletarians disposal, speak common prostitutes, take greatest pleasure seducing other's wives. Bourgeois marriage reality system wives common thus, most, Communists might possibly reproached with, desire introduce, substitution hypocritically concealed, openly legalised community women. For rest, self-evident abolition present system production must bring abolition community women springing system, i.e., prostitution public private. The Communists reproached desiring abolish countries nationality. The working men country. We cannot take got. Since proletariat must first acquire political supremacy, must rise leading class nation, must constitute nation, is, far, national, though bourgeois sense word. National differences antagonisms peoples daily vanishing, owing development bourgeoisie, freedom commerce, world-market, uniformity mode production conditions life corresponding thereto. The supremacy proletariat cause vanish still faster. United action, leading civilised countries least, one first conditions emancipation proletariat. In proportion exploitation one individual another put end to, exploitation one nation another also put end to. In proportion antagonism classes within nation vanishes, hostility one nation another come end. The charges Communism made religious, philosophical, and, generally, ideological standpoint, deserving serious examination. Does require deep intuition comprehend man's ideas, views conceptions, one word, man's consciousness, changes every change conditions material existence, social relations social life? What else history ideas prove, intellectual production changes character proportion material production changed? The ruling ideas age ever ideas ruling class. When people speak ideas revolutionise society, express fact, within old society, elements new one created, dissolution old ideas keeps even pace dissolution old conditions existence. When ancient world last throes, ancient religions overcome Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed 18th century rationalist ideas, feudal society fought death battle revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas religious liberty freedom conscience merely gave expression sway free competition within domain knowledge. "Undoubtedly," said, "religious, moral, philosophical juridical ideas modified course historical development. But religion, morality philosophy, political science, law, constantly survived change." "There are, besides, eternal truths, Freedom, Justice, etc. common states society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, abolishes religion, morality, instead constituting new basis; therefore acts contradiction past historical experience." What accusation reduce to? The history past society consisted development class antagonisms, antagonisms assumed different forms different epochs. But whatever form may taken, one fact common past ages, viz., exploitation one part society other. No wonder, then, social consciousness past ages, despite multiplicity variety displays, moves within certain common forms, general ideas, cannot completely vanish except total disappearance class antagonisms. The Communist revolution radical rupture traditional property relations; wonder development involves radical rupture traditional ideas. But let us done bourgeois objections Communism. We seen above, first step revolution working class, raise proletariat position ruling win battle democracy. The proletariat use political supremacy wrest, degrees, capital bourgeoisie, centralise instruments production hands State, i.e., proletariat organised ruling class; increase total productive forces rapidly possible. Of course, beginning, cannot effected except means despotic inroads rights property, conditions bourgeois production; means measures, therefore, appear economically insufficient untenable, which, course movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate inroads upon old social order, unavoidable means entirely revolutionising mode production. These measures course different different countries. Nevertheless advanced countries, following pretty generally applicable. 1. Abolition property land application rents land public purposes. 2. A heavy progressive graduated income tax. 3. Abolition right inheritance. 4. Confiscation property emigrants rebels. 5.

When, course development, class distinctions disappeared, production concentrated hands vast association whole nation, public power lose political character. Political power, properly called, merely organised power one class oppressing another. If proletariat contest bourgeoisie compelled, force circumstances, organise class, if, means revolution, makes ruling class, and, such, sweeps away force old conditions production, will, along conditions, swept away conditions existence class antagonisms classes generally, thereby abolished supremacy class. In place old bourgeois society, classes class antagonisms, shall association, free development condition free development all. III. SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE 1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM A. Feudal Socialism Owing historical position, became vocation aristocracies France England write pamphlets modern bourgeois society. In French revolution July 1830, English reform agitation, aristocracies succumbed hateful upstart. Thenceforth, serious political contest altogether question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even domain literature old cries restoration period become impossible. In order arouse sympathy, aristocracy obliged lose sight, apparently, interests, formulate indictment bourgeoisie interest exploited working class alone. Thus aristocracy took revenge singing lampoons new master, whispering ears sinister prophecies coming catastrophe. In way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half echo past, half menace future; times, bitter, witty incisive criticism, striking bourgeoisie heart's core; always ludicrous effect, total incapacity comprehend march modern history. The aristocracy, order rally people them, waved proletarian alms-bag front banner. But people, often joined them, saw hindquarters old feudal coats arms, deserted loud irreverent laughter. One section French Legitimists "Young England" exhibited spectacle. In pointing mode exploitation different bourgeoisie, feudalists forget exploited circumstances conditions quite different, antiquated. In showing that, rule, modern proletariat never existed, forget modern bourgeoisie necessary offspring form society. For rest, little conceal reactionary character criticism chief accusation bourgeoisie amounts this, bourgeois regime class developed, destined cut root branch old order society. What upbraid bourgeoisie much creates proletariat, creates revolutionary proletariat. In political practice, therefore, join coercive measures working class; ordinary life, despite high falutin phrases, stoop pick golden apples dropped tree industry, barter truth, love, honour traffic wool, beetroot-sugar, potato spirits. As parson ever gone hand hand landlord, Clerical Socialism Feudal Socialism. Nothing easier give Christian asceticism Socialist tinge. Has Christianity declaimed private property, marriage, State? Has preached place these, charity poverty, celibacy mortification flesh, monastic life Mother Church? Christian Socialism holy, water priest consecrates heart-burnings aristocrat. B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism The feudal aristocracy class ruined bourgeoisie, class whose conditions existence pined perished atmosphere modern bourgeois society. The mediaeval burgesses small peasant proprietors precursors modern bourgeoisie. In countries little developed, industrially commercially, two classes still vegetate side side rising bourgeoisie. In countries modern civilisation become fully developed, new class petty bourgeois formed, fluctuating proletariat bourgeoisie ever renewing supplementary part bourgeois society. The individual members class, however, constantly hurled proletariat action competition, and, modern industry develops, even see moment approaching completely disappear independent section modern society, replaced, manufactures, agriculture commerce, overlookers, bailiffs shopmen. In countries like France, peasants constitute far half population, natural writers sided proletariat bourgeoisie, use, criticism bourgeois regime, standard peasant petty bourgeois, standpoint intermediate classes take cudgels working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi head school, France also England. This school Socialism dissected great acuteness contradictions conditions modern production. It laid bare hypocritical apologies economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, disastrous effects machinery division labour; concentration capital land hands; overproduction crises; pointed inevitable ruin petty bourgeois peasant, misery proletariat, anarchy production, crying inequalities distribution wealth, industrial war extermination nations, dissolution old moral bonds, old family relations, old nationalities. In positive aims, however, form Socialism aspires either restoring old means production exchange, old property relations, old society, cramping modern means production exchange, within framework old property relations been, bound be, exploded means. In either case, reactionary Utopian. Its last words are: corporate guilds manufacture, patriarchal relations agriculture. Ultimately, stubborn historical facts dispersed intoxicating effects self-deception, form Socialism ended miserable fit blues. C. German, "True," Socialism The Socialist Communist literature France, literature originated pressure bourgeoisie power, expression struggle power, introduced Germany time bourgeoisie, country, begun contest feudal absolutism. German philosophers, would-be philosophers, beaux esprits, eagerly seized literature, forgetting, writings immigrated France Germany, French social conditions immigrated along them. In contact German social conditions, French literature lost immediate practical significance, assumed purely literary aspect. Thus, German philosophers eighteenth century, demands first French Revolution nothing demands "Practical Reason" general, utterance revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified eyes law pure Will, Will bound be, true human Will generally. The world German literate consisted solely bringing new French ideas harmony ancient philosophical conscience, rather, annexing French ideas without deserting philosophic point view. This annexation took place way foreign language appropriated, namely, translation. It well known monks wrote silly lives Catholic Saints manuscripts classical works ancient heathendom written. The German literate reversed process profane French literature. They wrote philosophical nonsense beneath French original. For instance, beneath French criticism economic functions money, wrote "Alienation Humanity," beneath French criticism bourgeois State wrote "dethronement Category General," forth. The introduction philosophical phrases back French historical criticisms dubbed "Philosophy Action," "True Socialism," "German Science Socialism," "Philosophical Foundation Socialism," on. The French Socialist Communist literature thus completely emasculated. And, since ceased hands German express struggle one class other, felt conscious overcome "French one-sidedness" representing, true requirements, requirements truth; interests proletariat, interests Human Nature, Man general, belongs class, reality, exists misty realm philosophical fantasy. This German Socialism, took schoolboy task seriously solemnly, extolled poor stock-in-trade mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost pedantic innocence. The fight German, especially, Prussian bourgeoisie, feudal aristocracy absolute monarchy, words, liberal movement, became earnest. By this, long wished-for opportunity offered "True" Socialism confronting political movement Socialist demands, hurling traditional anathemas liberalism, representative government, bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty equality, preaching masses nothing gain, everything lose, bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, nick time, French criticism, whose silly echo was, presupposed existence modern bourgeois society, corresponding economic conditions existence, political constitution adapted thereto, things whose attainment object pending struggle Germany. To absolute governments, following parsons, professors, country squires officials, served welcome scarecrow threatening bourgeoisie. It sweet finish bitter pills floggings bullets governments, time, dosed German working-class risings. While "True" Socialism thus served governments weapon fighting German bourgeoisie, it, time, directly represented reactionary interest, interest German Philistines. In Germany petty-bourgeois class, relic sixteenth century, since constantly cropping various forms, real social basis existing state things. To preserve class preserve existing state things Germany. The industrial political supremacy bourgeoisie threatens certain destruction; one hand, concentration capital; other, rise revolutionary proletariat. "True" Socialism appeared kill two birds one stone. It spread like epidemic. The robe speculative cobwebs, embroidered flowers rhetoric, steeped dew sickly sentiment, transcendental robe German Socialists wrapped sorry "eternal truths," skin bone, served wonderfully increase sale goods amongst public. And part, German Socialism recognised, more, calling bombastic representative petty-bourgeois Philistine. It proclaimed German nation model nation, German petty Philistine typical man. To every villainous meanness model man gave hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, exact contrary real character. It went extreme length directly opposing "brutally destructive" tendency Communism, proclaiming supreme impartial contempt class struggles. With exceptions, so-called Socialist Communist publications (1847) circulate Germany belong domain foul enervating literature. 2. CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM A part bourgeoisie desirous redressing social grievances, order secure continued existence bourgeois society. To section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers condition working class, organisers charity, members societies prevention cruelty animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers every imaginable kind. This form Socialism has, moreover, worked complete systems. We may cite Proudhon's Philosophie de la Misere example form. The Socialistic bourgeois want advantages modern social conditions without struggles dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire existing state society minus revolutionary disintegrating elements. They wish bourgeoisie without proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives world supreme best; bourgeois Socialism develops comfortable conception various less complete systems. In requiring proletariat carry system, thereby march straightway social New Jerusalem, requires reality, proletariat remain within bounds existing society, cast away hateful ideas concerning bourgeoisie. A second practical, less systematic, form Socialism sought depreciate every revolutionary movement eyes working class, showing mere political reform, change material conditions existence, economic relations, could advantage them. By changes material conditions existence, form Socialism, however, means understands abolition bourgeois relations production, abolition effected revolution, administrative reforms, based continued existence relations; reforms, therefore, respect affect relations capital labour, but, best, lessen cost, simplify administrative work, bourgeois government. Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, when, becomes mere figure speech. Free trade: benefit working class. Protective duties: benefit working class. Prison Reform: benefit working class. This last word seriously meant word bourgeois Socialism. It summed phrase: bourgeois bourgeois--for benefit working class. 3. CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM We refer literature which, every great modern revolution, always given voice demands proletariat, writings Babeuf others. The first direct attempts proletariat attain ends, made times universal excitement, feudal society overthrown, attempts necessarily failed, owing undeveloped state proletariat, well absence economic conditions emancipation, conditions yet produced, could produced impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature accompanied first movements proletariat necessarily reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism social levelling crudest form. The Socialist Communist systems properly called, Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen others, spring existence early undeveloped period, described above, struggle proletariat bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois Proletarians). The founders systems see, indeed, class antagonisms, well action decomposing elements, prevailing form society. But proletariat, yet infancy, offers spectacle class without historical initiative independent political movement. Since development class antagonism keeps even pace development industry, economic situation, find it, yet offer material conditions emancipation proletariat. They therefore search new social science, new social laws, create conditions. Historical action yield personal inventive action, historically created conditions emancipation fantastic ones, gradual, spontaneous class-organisation proletariat organisation society specially contrived inventors. Future history resolves itself, eyes, propaganda practical carrying social plans. In formation plans conscious caring chiefly interests working class, suffering class. Only point view suffering class proletariat exist them. The undeveloped state class struggle, well surroundings, causes Socialists kind consider far superior class antagonisms. They want improve condition every member society, even favoured. Hence, habitually appeal society large, without distinction class; nay, preference, ruling class. For people, understand system, fail see best possible plan best possible state society? Hence, reject political, especially revolutionary, action; wish attain ends peaceful means, endeavour, small experiments, necessarily doomed failure, force example, pave way new social Gospel. Such fantastic pictures future society, painted time proletariat still undeveloped state fantastic conception position correspond first instinctive yearnings class general reconstruction society. But Socialist Communist publications contain also critical element. They attack every principle existing society. Hence full valuable materials enlightenment working class. The practical measures proposed them--such abolition distinction town country, family, carrying industries account private individuals, wage system, proclamation social harmony, conversion functions State mere superintendence production, proposals, point solely disappearance class antagonisms were, time, cropping up, which, publications, recognised earliest, indistinct undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, purely Utopian character. The significance Critical-Utopian Socialism Communism bears inverse relation historical development. In proportion modern class struggle develops takes definite shape, fantastic standing apart contest, fantastic attacks it, lose practical value theoretical justification. Therefore, although originators systems were, many respects, revolutionary, disciples have, every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast original views masters, opposition progressive historical development proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, consistently, deaden class struggle reconcile class antagonisms. They still dream experimental realisation social Utopias, founding isolated "phalansteres," establishing "Home Colonies," setting "Little Icaria"--duodecimo editions New Jerusalem--and realise castles air, compelled appeal feelings purses bourgeois. By degrees sink category reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above, differing systematic pedantry, fanatical superstitious belief miraculous effects social science. They, therefore, violently oppose political action part working class; action, according them, result blind unbelief new Gospel. The Owenites England, Fourierists France, respectively, oppose Chartists Reformistes. IV. POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES Section II made clear relations Communists existing working-class parties, Chartists England Agrarian Reformers America. The Communists fight attainment immediate aims, enforcement momentary interests working class; movement present, also represent take care future movement. In France Communists ally Social-Democrats, conservative radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, right take critical position regard phrases illusions traditionally handed great Revolution. In Switzerland support Radicals, without losing sight fact party consists antagonistic elements, partly Democratic Socialists, French sense, partly radical bourgeois. In Poland support party insists agrarian revolution prime condition national emancipation, party fomented insurrection Cracow 1846. In Germany fight bourgeoisie whenever acts revolutionary way, absolute monarchy, feudal squirearchy, petty bourgeoisie. But never cease, single instant, instil working class clearest possible recognition hostile antagonism bourgeoisie proletariat, order German workers may straightaway use, many weapons bourgeoisie, social political conditions bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along supremacy, order that, fall reactionary classes Germany, fight bourgeoisie may immediately begin. The Communists turn attention chiefly Germany, country eve bourgeois revolution bound carried advanced conditions European civilisation, much developed proletariat, England seventeenth, France eighteenth century, bourgeois revolution Germany prelude immediately following proletarian revolution. In short, Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement existing social political order things. In movements bring front, leading question each, property question, matter degree development time. Finally, labour everywhere union agreement democratic parties countries. The Communists disdain conceal views aims. They openly declare ends attained forcible overthrow existing social conditions. Let ruling classes tremble Communistic revolution. The proletarians nothing lose chains. They world win. WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!
